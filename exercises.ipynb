    "# Making HTTP Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are many libraries to make HTTP requests. We will use a 3rd-party library called \"requests\", which is very easy to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making a \"GET\" request is as simple as: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",

    "res = requests.get(url) # returns a \"Response\" object\n",
    "res.content # has the \"body\" of the response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might need to install the requests library! \n",
    "\n",
    "You can do that with the following code in a Jupyter cell: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "! pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if you're using anaconda, optionally you can also do: \n",
